This code was developed as part of a research project conducted by Jonah Kim and funded by the Northwestern University Summer Undergraduate Research Grant.
The code is a Monte-Carlo study on the Blume-Capel model, a model used in condensed matter physics to describe the behavior of complex materials.
I employ Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo methods to sample the state space of the model at different system sizes, and I use asymptotic analysis to extract quantities for the infinite size limit.
The code is parallelized using the OpenMP API.
The study was conducted using Quest, Northwestern University's HPC cluster.
